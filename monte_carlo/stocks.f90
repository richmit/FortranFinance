!!  This program runs 2000 (trials) stocks simulations on $100 (initial_value).  Each simulation is over 20 (years) years of
!!  stocks using the last 30 (mc_history_years) years of historical US stocks data.  This program prints the resulting
!!  value of each simulation to STDOUT.  If placed in a file, this data may be consumed by stocks.R to produce a
!!  nice histogram showing the probability of the value after 100 years.
!!
!!  This technique is frequently called "monte carlo" in finance circles.  The heart of the idea is pretty simple.  Simulate the
!!  scenario using resampled values from historical data, and then analyze the result.
