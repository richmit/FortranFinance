The functionality powering the programs published in the [[https://github.com/richmit/FortranFinance][FortranFinance]] repository is contained in the
[[https://github.com/richmit/FortranFinance/tree/main/MRFFL][MR Fortran Finance Library (MRFFL)]].  MRFFL is a collection of Fortran modules that include
advanced TVM solver computations, cashflow stream analysis, US tax calculations, and some monte carlo capabilities (US interest rates & US stock market
returns).

API documentation may be found here: [[https://www.mitchr.me/SS/FortranFinance/MRFFL_API_Docs/index.html][MR Fortran Finance Library (MRFFL) API Documentation]]

The TVM solvers differs from other TVM software I've used in that both annuities (level/geometric/arithmatic) and lump sums are generalized.  Annuity payments
can stop and start on arbitrary period boundaries within the term.  Similarly, lump sums can occur at any payment boundary.  This means the solvers can handle
a variety of lump sum & annuity types (due, ordinary, delayed, early ending).  Together this allows one to solve some difficult, non-standard TVM problems.

The cashflow stream module uses a similar generalization in that cashflows can be placed at any period boundary.  This eliminates the need to treat the
cashflow at time zero as special.  It also eliminates the need to bother with that BEGIN or END mode nonsense.  Without these complications we can group
cashflow sequences together without worry about the mode of each or period alignment issues that plague some other cashflow software.  The module includes
cashflow series builders using the same notation and variables as the TVM solvers allowing one to use the TVM solvers to find necessary values, and then use
the same variables to populate a cashflow that can be further analyzed or printed.

** Building Example Programs With GNU Make
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: examples-build-make
:END:

This section describes how to build using GNU Make.  A [[#examples-build-cmake][later section]] describes how to build with CMake.

The GNU Make based build is the one I use day to day, and thus gets more testing and is more complete.  In order to compile on your platform you may need to
modify the ~makefile~ in each directory to use your favorite Fortran compiler.  At the top of each makefile you will find something like this:

#+begin_src sh :results output verbatum :exports results :wrap "src makefile :eval never :tangle no"
head -n 20 ../../MRFFL_unit_tests/makefile | grep -B 20 '#####' | grep -A 20 '#####' | sed -E 's/^####*/################################################/'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src makefile :eval never :tangle no
################################################

MRFFL_PATH = ../MRFFL

include $(MRFFL_PATH)/tools_gfortran.mk
# include $(MRFFL_PATH)/tools_flang.mk
# include $(MRFFL_PATH)/tools_ifx.mk
# include $(MRFFL_PATH)/tools_lfortran.mk
# include $(MRFFL_PATH)/tools_nvfortran.mk

include $(MRFFL_PATH)/include.mk

################################################
#+end_src

If you are using ~gfortran~ on a UNIX'ish system, then you can probably just leave it as is.  If you want to use a different compiler, then you may be able to
simply uncomment the appropriate line if your system is similarly configured to mine.  If you are unlucky, then you may need to set some variables.  In
particular, you might need to comment out the ~gfortran~ include and add something like this:

#+begin_src sh :results output verbatum :exports results :wrap "src makefile :eval never :tangle no"
~/core/codeBits/bin/src2orgListing ../../MRFFL/tools_nvfortran.mk
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src makefile :eval never :tangle no
AR := ar
FC := nvfortran
FFLAGS := -O3 -Wall  -W -Xlinker -z -Xlinker execstack
FSHFLG = -o $(MRFFL_SHARED_LIB_FILE) -shared $(MRFFL_OBJ_FILES)
#+end_src

The only tricky one is the ~FSHFLG~ variable.  Luckily you only need the ~FSHFLG~ variable if you plan on building a shared library.  The shared library is
completely unnecessary for making full use of the modules, so you you can safely ignore that one unless you really, really want to use a shared library. ~;)~

** Building Example Programs With CMake
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: examples-build-cmake
:END:

This section describes how to build using CMake.  A [[#examples-build-make][previous section]] describes how to build with GNU Make.

Most of the programs in [[https://github.com/richmit/FortranFinance][FortranFinance]] make use of MRFFL.  When using a CMake based workflow, MRFFL is accessed
via a central include directory of compiled module files and a static library.  Before we can compile any examples, we must create these module files and
library. 

#+begin_src sh
cd MRFFL/build
rm -rf *
cmake .. -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran
cmake --build .
#+end_src

Now that MRFFL is compiled, we can make use of it.  As an example, we can build the =irr= executable in the =cashflows= directory like so:

#+begin_src sh
cd cashflows/build
rm -rf *
cmake .. -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran
cmake --build .
#+end_src

* Using MRFFL (MR Fortran Finance Library) Modules
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: use
:END:


** Using CMake
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: use-cmake
:END:

In the [[#examples-build-cmake][section on building examples]] we build the MRFFL library using CMake.  This process will result in several new files and
directories:

 - =MRFFL/build/lib/= will contain the compiled MRFFL library.
 - =MRFFL/build/modules/= will contain the generated module files.
 - =MRFFL/build/MRFFL.cmake/= a CMake include file that can be used to compile things with the MRFFL library.

For the most part, the following compilers are well supported:
 - GNU Fortran
 - Intel ifx
 - NVIDIA HPC Fortran
 - Flang

If you are using a compiler not on this list, then more configuration may be required (=-DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS= for example).

With MRFFL compiled using CMake, we can use it from another project.  The =cashflows= directory contains an example =CMakeLists.txt= for the =irr= executable:

#+begin_src sh :results output verbatum :exports results :wrap "src cmake :eval never :tangle no"
~/core/codeBits/bin/src2orgListing ../../cashflows/CMakeLists.txt
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src cmake :eval never :tangle no
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.30)

project(MRFFL_cashflow_examples VERSION 0.1
        DESCRIPTION "Examples for MRFFL_cashflows module"
        LANGUAGES Fortran)

set(CMAKE_Fortran_PREPROCESS NO)

# Find and include the MRFFL.cmake file.  This will setup the MRFFL library -- it's include dirs and link dir.
if(EXISTS "../../MRFFL/build/MRFFL.cmake")
  message(STATUS " MRFFL Search: Found: Exported")
  include("../MRFFL/build/MRFFL.cmake")
  if(NOT (EXISTS "../../MRFFL/build/modules/mrffl_config.mod") )
    message(ERROR " MRFFL Search: Found exported cmake file, but MRFFL library has not been built!!!")
  endif()
else()
  message(ERROR " MRFFL Search: Failed!!!")
endif()

add_executable(irr irr.f90)
target_link_libraries(irr PRIVATE MRFFL)
#+end_src

That's really all we need to ake use of MRFFL.  Note this =CMakeLists.txt= uses =MRFFL.cmake=, but this is not strictly required. The paths can be set by
hand, and the following would work instead:

#+begin_src cmake :eval never :tangle no
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.30)

project(MRFFL_cashflow_examples VERSION 0.1
        DESCRIPTION "Examples for MRFFL_cashflows module"
        LANGUAGES Fortran)

set(CMAKE_Fortran_PREPROCESS NO)

add_executable(irr irr.f90)
target_link_libraries(irr PRIVATE MRFFL)
target_include_directories(irr AFTER PRIVATE ../MRFFL/build/modules)
target_link_directories(irr BEFORE PRIVATE ../MRFFL/build/lib)
#+end_src


** Using GNU Make
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: use-make
:END:

All of the code is in the module source files with no external dependencies at all.  So you just need to call the modules from your code, and then
compile/link everything together.


To help with that compile/link part, a makefile fragment has been provided
([[https://github.com/richmit/FortranFinance/tree/main/MRFFL/include.mk][~include.mk~]]).  Note it works with GNU make and is designed for UNIX-like
environments (Mac OS X, Linux, MSYS2 on Windows 11, WSL on Windows 11).  I mostly use MSYS2 on Windows 11 so that is where it gets the most testing.  The
makefile in the [[https://github.com/richmit/FortranFinance/tree/main/MRFFL_functional_tests][functional tests directory]] is a good guide on how to use
[[https://github.com/richmit/FortranFinance/tree/main/MRFFL/include.mk][~include.mk~]].  In essence you do the following in your makefile:

  1) Set MRFFL_PATH in your makefile to the path of the MRFFL source directory -- that's the one with the ~include.mk~ file.
  2) Set FC, FFLAGS, & AR if necessary -- most of the time you can use the defaults.
  3) Include the "~include.mk~" file in the MRFFL source directory.
  4) Add a build rule for your program.

Your makefile will look something like this:

#+begin_src makefile
MRFFL_PATH = ../MRFFL

# Set FC, FFLAGS, & AR here.  The include below has the settings I use on my system.	
include $(MRFFL_PATH)/tools_gfortran.mk 

include $(MRFFL_PATH)/include.mk

your_program : your_program.f90 $(MRFFL_OBJ_FILES)
	$(FC) $(FFLAGS) $^ -o $@
#+end_src

Note the rule in the makefile above takes the lazy approach of adding every MRFFL module as a dependency regardless of if your program actually needs them
all.  This is how most people use the modules because it's simple.  The cost might be a couple seconds of extra compile time.  You can explicitly list out the
modules in the makefile if you wish.  Such a rule might look like the following:

#+begin_src makefile
your_program : your_program.f90 mrffl_config$(OBJ_SUFFIX) mrffl_tvm$(OBJ_SUFFIX) mrffl_solver$(OBJ_SUFFIX) 
	$(FC) $(FFLAGS) $^ -o $@
#+end_src

*** Notes about ~include.mk~

:END:

**** Names of files
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: makeinc-names
:END:

  - File extensions on Windows (outside of WSL) ::
   - Executable files use ~.exe~
   - Shared libraries use ~.dll~
   - Object files will ~.obj~
  - On UNIX systems (not including MSYS2) ::
   - Executable files have no extension
   - Shared libraries use ~.so~
   - Object files will use ~.o~

**** Useful Variables
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: makeinc-vars
:END:

  - ~MRFFL_MOD_FILES~       :: All the module (~.mod~) files.  These will appear in your build directory.
  - ~MRFFL_OBJ_FILES~       :: All the object (~.obj~ or ~.o~) files.  These will appear in your build directory.
  - ~MRFFL_STATIC_LIB_FILE~ :: The name of the static library file.  It's not created by default.  It will appear in your build directory if it is listed as a dependency on one of your targets.
  - ~MRFFL_SHARED_LIB_FILE~ :: The name of the shared library file.  It's not created by default.  It will appear in your build directory if it is listed as a dependency on one of your targets.

**** Useful Targets
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: makeinc-target
:END:

  - ~all_mrffl_lib~     :: Builds the library files.
  - ~all_mrffl_mod~     :: Builds the module (~.mod~) files
  - ~all_mrffl_obj~     :: Builds the object (~.obj~ or ~.o~) files
  - ~clean_mrffl_mod~   :: Deletes all the MRFFL module (~.mod~) files in the build directory.
  - ~clean_mrffl_obj~   :: Deletes all the MRFFL object (~.obj~ or ~.o~) files in the build directory.
  - ~clean_mrffl_lib~   :: Deletes all the library files in the build directory.
  - ~clean_mrffl~       :: Simply calls the following targets: ~clean_mrffl_mod~, ~clean_mrffl_obj~, & ~clean_mrffl_lib~
  - ~clean_multi_mrffl~ :: The previous clean targets will only remove products from the current platform.  For example, the ~clean_mrffl_obj~ target will
                           delete object files with an extension of ~.obj~ on windows and an extension of ~.o~ on UNIX'ish platforms.  I use the same directories to
                           build for all platforms, so I sometimes want to clean up the build products from all platforms at once.  That's what this target will do.

**** Static Library
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: makeinc-stlib
:END:

A rule to make a static library is included in ~include.mk~.  A build rule like the following should build that library and link it to your executable.  Note
I'm just including the library file on the command line instead of linker like options (i.e. ~-L~ and ~-l~ for GNU compilers).  That's because simply including
the library on the command line is broadly supported across more compilers -- this way I don't have to document how to do the same thing for each one. ;)

#+begin_src makefile
your_program : your_program.f90 $(MRFFL_STATIC_LIB_FILE)
	$(FC) $(FFLAGS) $^ $(MRFFL_STATIC_LIB_FILE) -o $@
#+end_src

**** Dynamic Library (~.so~ and ~.dll~ files)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: makeinc-dylib
:END:

A rule to make a static library is included in ~include.mk~.  You can build it with the target ~clean_mrffl_lib~, or by using ~$(MRFFL_SHARED_LIB_FILE)~ as a
dependency in your build rule.  As the options to link to a shared library differ wildly across platforms and compilers/linkers, I don't provide an example of
how to do that.
