# MRFFL Unit Tests

This directory contains some unit tests for [MRFFL](https://richmit.github.io/FortranFinance/MRFFL/index.html).

I use the phrase "unit test" liberally here.  No unite test framework
is used.  The test programs simply print out results to a file that is
compared to a known good output file.
