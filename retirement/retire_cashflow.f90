!!  In this program we consider a retirement scenario using MRFFL's cashflow module.
!!
!!  Retirement scenario:
!!    - Savings: 2M
!!    - Pension: Starts in 5 years at 24k per year and then grows with inflation
!!    - Annual expenses: 90k including taxes
!!    - Total life expectancy: 25 years
!!    - Inflation: 3%
!!    - Investment growth rate: 3%
