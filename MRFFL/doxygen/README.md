# MRFFL Doxygen Configuration

This directory contains Doxygen configuration files.  Running Doxygen in this
directory will result in generated documentation being created in a sub-directory called
'autodocs'.  This is a nice way to generate a local copy of the MRFFL documentation.

I use this directory to stage generated documentation before I move it
to my web site.
