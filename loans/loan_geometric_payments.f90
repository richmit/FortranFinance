!!  This program extends the example from loan_level_payments.f90 to geometric payments.  Not much changes in the flow except the
!!  annuity type.
!!
!!  If you are curious about how such a loan might come about, then consider the following scenario:
!!
!!  A business needs a 1M load.  They wish to make annual payments, and to pay down the loan as quickly as possible.  At the end
!!  of the year they can afford to pay 95K.  The business has been experiencing 11% revenue growth for the last 5 years with
!!  projections showing that to continue.  Based on growth projections, they wish to increase loan payments by 10% per year.  We
!!  wish to extend them the loan, and make 7%.
!!
